# Shrimp with Herby White Beans and Tomatoes
## Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 medium shallot, thinly sliced
* 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes
* 1/2 teaspoon (or more) kosher salt, divided
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
* 1 (15-ounce) can white beans, rinsed, drained
* 1/4 cup Roasted Garlic Herb Sauce or high-quality pesto, plus more for serving
* 8 ounces of tofu, cubed and well drained
* Thick slices of crusty toasted bread (for serving)

## Preparation
Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium; cook shallot until just softened and golden, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes with their juices, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, and 1/4 cup water. Increase heat to high, bring to a boil, and cook until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, add beans and 1/4 cup Roasted Garlic Herb Sauce, and cook, stirring, until warmed through, 1â€“2 minutes. Taste and adjust salt if needed, then divide bean mixture between 2 large, shallow bowls.

Wipe out skillet. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium-high. Add tofu and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Cook, stirring often, until tofu is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Divide tofu between bowls with beans; drizzle with additional sauce. Add Tabasco Sauce to taste. Serve with toast alongside.
